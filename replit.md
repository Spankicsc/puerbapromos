# Overview

Promospedia is a nostalgic encyclopedia web application dedicated to preserving and cataloging Mexican promotional items and collectibles. The platform focuses on famous promotional campaigns from Mexican brands like Sabritas, Gamesa, Barcel, Bimbo, Marinela, and Vual√°, featuring iconic items such as Tazos, stickers, spinners, and Funki Punky collectibles. The application serves as a comprehensive database where users can explore brands, their promotional campaigns, and individual collectible items with detailed information including rarity levels and historical context.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript and follows a modern component-based architecture. The application uses Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized builds. The routing system is implemented using Wouter, a lightweight client-side router.

The UI framework is based on shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing a consistent and accessible design system. Tailwind CSS handles styling with custom CSS variables for theme management, supporting both light and dark modes. The design system uses a custom color palette centered around yellow (#FFD700) as the primary brand color.

State management is handled through TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, providing caching, background updates, and optimistic updates. The application follows a hook-based pattern for data fetching and state management.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is built using Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design pattern. The server implements middleware for JSON parsing, URL encoding, request logging, and error handling. The application uses a modular route structure with separate route handlers for different entity types.

The server includes a custom logging system that tracks API requests with response times and status codes. Error handling is centralized through Express middleware that standardizes error responses and provides appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a dual storage approach:
- **Development/Demo**: In-memory storage implementation with pre-seeded data representing authentic Mexican promotional campaigns
- **Production**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

The database schema includes three main entities:
- **Brands**: Store brand information including name, slug, description, primary color, and founding year
- **Promotions**: Campaign information linked to brands with categories, date ranges, and descriptions
- **Promotion Items**: Individual collectible items with rarity levels, item numbers, and flexible metadata storage

Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and automatic TypeScript type generation from the schema. The schema uses UUID primary keys and includes proper foreign key relationships between entities.

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently, the application does not implement user authentication or authorization mechanisms. The API endpoints are publicly accessible, focusing on read-only operations for browsing the promotional item catalog.

## Build and Deployment Strategy
The application uses a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript schemas between frontend and backend. The build process creates optimized static assets for the frontend and bundles the backend into a single executable file using esbuild.

Development workflow includes:
- Separate development servers for frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx)
- Shared TypeScript configuration with path mapping
- Hot module replacement for rapid development
- Type checking across the entire codebase
